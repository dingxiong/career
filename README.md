## Collection of classical algorithms
- Dijkstra's algorithm
- uniform-cost search  
	> Dijkstra's algorithm searches for shortest paths from root to every other node in a graph, whereas uniform-cost searches for shortest paths in terms of cost to a goal node. 
- A* algorithm 
- Bellmanâ€“Ford algorithm  
	> Dijkstar's algorithm cannot handle negative weight edges, but Bellman-Ford does. 
- [TODO] Johnson's algorithm
- Radix sort

## Collection of classical algorithms
- Dijkstra's algorithm `LC743`
- uniform-cost search  
	> Dijkstra's algorithm searches for shortest paths from root to every other node in a graph, whereas uniform-cost searches for shortest paths in terms of cost to a goal node. 
- A* algorithm 
- Bellman–Ford algorithm  `LC743`
	> Dijkstar's algorithm cannot handle negative weight edges, but Bellman-Ford does. 
- Floyd–Warshall algorithm
- Shortest Path Faster Algorithm (SPFA) `LC743`
	> An improvement on top of Bellman-Ford
- Johnson's algorithm
- Radix sort
- Union find `LC 765`

## Data structures  
**Ones should master**
- Red black tree 
- AVL
- Trie tree (radix tree, prefix tree) `LC720, LC754`
	- understand `compressions`

**One should know about**
- B-Tree
- Suffix tree
